# MSP430FR2355-C0-Concentration
   This project is a device for measuring the concentration of CO in the air, displayed on an LCD display that uses i2c 
and that will notify you by sound using a buzzer when it exceeds the threshold value of 400 ppm. It uses UART to transmit data so it can be shown on console.
