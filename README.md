# MSP430FR2355-C0-Concentration

   This project is a device for measuring CO concentration in the air using an MQ2 sensor, displayed on an LCD screen with I2C communication. It will provide an audio alert using a buzzer when the threshold value of 400 ppm is exceeded. It uses UART to transmit data so that it can be displayed on the console.
